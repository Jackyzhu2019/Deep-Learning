After intermittent study in my part time last year, I am proud to say that I have entered into deep learning world, althrough my understanding is not deep. Thanks to the book named "深度学习之美-AI时代的数据处理与最佳实践", with its guidence, I systematically learnt the DL concepts by practicing its coding examples chapter by chapter.

The traditional machine learning needs us to find the object features firstly and do the recognition or other jobs. However, deep learning will utilize big data and complex model to find the features itself. 

For traditional ML, I have done following experiments:
   => linear regression
   => KNN(K-th nearest neighbors)
   => perceptron
   => SVD
   => BP (the premise of deep learning)


For deep learning, I have done following experiments with tensorflow:
   => CNN
   => RNN
   => LSTM
